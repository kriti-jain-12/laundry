                App tries to make sure that Customers are happy with the Laundry Services provided by Bidriver or Pro
                Launderers, but we understand that this is not always going to be the case. When a Customer is not
                satisfied with Laundry Services that are provided, and such dissatisfaction is reported to Laundry On
                App (e.g., damages or lost garments, weight of laundry) we may, at our discretion, issue a refund or
                adjust the Order Fee, and any components thereof, for such Order. As a result, this may affect the
                amount paid to Bidriver or Pro Launderer. We call these instances &ldquo;Order Disputes.&rdquo; A Order
                Dispute includes, but is not limited to, the following: (a) when a Bidriver or Pro Launderer is
                incapable of or unwilling to adequately perform the Laundry Services agreed to for the Order; (b) when a
                Bidriver or Pro Launderer inaccurately verifies the weight of the Laundry into the Platforms, and, as a
                result, was or may be overpaid for the Order; (c) if during the Order, a Bidriver or Pro Launderer
                damages or loses garment(s) or did not comply with safety or health standards or customer requests that
                were required given the nature of the particular Order. If a Customer submits an Order Dispute, Laundry
                On App will investigate the matter. Investigation may require the Bidriver or Pro Launderer to return to
                the Customer&rsquo;s residence to reweigh the laundry. After Laundry On App receives an Order Dispute,
                we will contact Bidriver or Pro Launderers and Customers to provide any information regarding the
                matter. Based on the Investigation and in the sole discretion of Laundry On App, it may withhold payment
                from the Bidriver or Pro Launderer &ndash; in whole or in part, provide an extra payment to the Bidriver
                or Pro Launderer, and require the Customer to pay a full or partial amount for completion of the
